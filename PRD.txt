# Kitchen Cabinet Calculator - Product Requirements Document

# Overview
The Kitchen Cabinet Calculator is a specialized tool designed for sales representatives in the cabinetry and remodeling industry. This application enables sales reps to quickly generate accurate price estimates for cabinetry remodeling projects. Initially focused on kitchen remodels, with future plans to expand to other rooms (bathroom, laundry room, bedroom, etc.). After configuring the remodel specifications, sales reps can generate and print detailed pricing reports to present to potential customers, streamlining the sales process and improving customer experience.
